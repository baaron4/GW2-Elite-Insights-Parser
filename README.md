# GW2-Elite-Insights-Parser
## Set Up

1. Go to Release section.

2. Download the GW2EI.zip file from the latest release. Don't forget to check regularly to stay updated (we have a channel that notifies new releases on our discord).

3. Extract all files anywhere you like.

4. Launch GW2EI.exe (UI or console).

NOTE: ArcDPS log files are currently located within "C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Documents\Guild Wars 2\addons\arcdps\arcdps.cbtlogs"
## UI Usage
![program](./docs/Images/EILook.PNG)

1. Drag and drop 1 or multiple .evtc, .evtc.zip or .zevtc files into program.

2. Click parse.

3. Click open when parsing done.

You can change the settings at any time using the Settings window.

## Console Usage

![how to](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30677999/40148954-6ec9215a-5936-11e8-94ad-d2520e7c4539.PNG)

If you would like to have your logs parsed without the GUI pass the file location of each evtc file as a string. 

Settings can be configured using .conf files (see Settings/sample.conf for an example). You can then use it with -c:

```
GuildWars2EliteInsights.exe -c [config path] [logs]
```

To disable windows-specific commandline magic you can use -p:

```
GuildWars2EliteInsights.exe -p [logs]
```

You can also start the application in GUI mode using -ui option:
```
GuildWars2EliteInsights.exe -c [config path] -ui [logs]
```

Note it may take some time for each file to parse and they will not be ready to open the moment they are created.
